# pi-zero-multi
Working project for getting multiple OTG profiles running on the Pi zero

This will be a tracker and container for all things USB gadget for the Pi
Mainly trying to get USB ethernet and mass storage working at the same time, mostly so the correct drivers can be stored on the device to get the USB ethernet working on older OSs
Many guides out there are out of date, missing, or never got both working at the same time, maybe g_multi is just broke, maybe there is something better.

Current guides:

USB flash drive guide- https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/articles/pi-zero-w-smart-usb-flash-drive <br>
Ethernet gadget guide - https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget/ethernet-gadget
